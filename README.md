**Big O(No)** is a lovingly curated collection of sorting algorithms that should never, ever be used. Each algorithm comes with its own unique persona and distinctive approach to achieving "sorted" results.

Some lose data. Some take forever. All are completely impractical. **But they're fun.**

## ⏳ Wait Sort

*"Good things come to those who wait... and wait... and wait..."*

### Inspiration

If you put every number in a separate thread and tell each one to sleep for however many seconds its value is, the small numbers wake up first. That's it. That's the sort. No comparisons, no swaps — just time doing the work. The idea came from watching how things naturally fall into order when you let their size dictate how long they take.

The most patient sorting algorithm ever conceived. Each number spawns a thread that sleeps for a duration proportional to its value. Smaller numbers wake up first, naturally yielding a sorted output.

**How it works:**
1. Spawn a thread for each number
2. Each thread sleeps for `value` seconds
3. When a thread wakes, it adds its number to the result
4. Smaller numbers finish first → **Sorted!**

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(max(n)) — determined by your largest number
- Space: O(n) threads
- Patience: 100% required

```bash
# Sort [5, 2, 8, 1, 3] - takes ~8 seconds
big-oh-no wait 5 2 8 1 3
```

## ☭ Stalin Sort

*"In Soviet Russia, list sorts YOU"*

### Inspiration

Stalin ran the Soviet Union by removing people who didn't fit. Not relocating them, not giving them another chance — just gone. The scary part is it worked, in a narrow sense: the people left were the ones who conformed. The state looked organised. It just had a lot fewer people in it than it started with.

Stalin Sort does the same thing. Anything that breaks the sorted order gets deleted on the spot. What's left is sorted. Whether you still have all your numbers is not the algorithm's concern.

A sorting algorithm that achieves order through elimination. Any element that dares to be smaller than the previous maximum is simply... removed. The survivors form a perfectly sorted list.

**How it works:**
1. Start with the first element as the current maximum
2. Iterate through the list
3. If element >= current max → **survives** (update max)
4. If element < current max → **eliminated** 💀
5. Survivors are sorted!

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
- Casualties: O(n)

```bash
# Input: [5, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 10]
# Output: [5, 9, 10]
# Eliminated: [1, 2, 8, 3]
big-oh-no stalin 5 1 9 2 8 3 10
```

## 🐧 Linus Sort

*"Your code is bad and you should feel bad"*

### Inspiration

Linus Torvalds built Linux and has been reviewing kernel patches for decades. He is not known for being gentle about bad code. His emails on the Linux kernel mailing list became famous — "this is garbage", "what were you thinking", flat NAKs with no explanation. The idea is that if you submit something that makes the codebase worse, it gets rejected and you feel bad about it. It keeps the tree clean.

Linus Sort applies that to numbers. Each one gets submitted as a patch. If it keeps the sequence moving forward, it's in. If it doesn't, it's NAK'd.

Each element is submitted as a "patch" for review by a simulated Linus Torvalds. Patches that maintain monotonic order are merged with begrudging approval. Those that don't are NAK'd with colorful commentary.

**How it works:**
1. Submit your "patches" (numbers) for review
2. Linus reviews each one with brutal honesty
3. Patches >= current max are **merged** (barely acceptable)
4. Patches < current max are **NAK'd** (with extreme prejudice)
5. Result: A "clean" git history

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
- Hurt feelings: O(n)

```bash
# Input: [3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 5, 12]
# Merged: [3, 7, 9, 12]
# NAK'd: [1, 2, 5]
big-oh-no linus 3 1 7 2 9 5 12
```

## 🎲 Bogo Sort

*"If we shuffle enough times, eventually statistics will apologize."*

### Inspiration

The infinite monkey theorem says that if you had a monkey randomly hitting keys forever, it would eventually type out any text you want — including a sorted list. This is mathematically true and completely pointless in practice. The time it would take is so absurdly long it makes the age of the universe look like nothing. Bogo Sort is the algorithm that heard this and thought "yeah, let's do that".

This algorithm keeps randomly shuffling the list and checking whether it is sorted. It is technically valid and practically awful.

**How it works:**
1. Check if the current list is sorted
2. If not, shuffle randomly
3. Repeat until sorted (or you run out of patience)

**Complexity:**
- Expected Time: O((n+1)!)
- Space: O(1)
- Reliability: Depends on luck

Optional parameter:
- `--max-attempts <n>` limits shuffle attempts before timing out (default: `10000`)

```bash
# Input: [3, 2, 1]
# Output (eventually): [1, 2, 3]
big-oh-no bogo 3 2 1

# Cap attempts for faster feedback while demoing
big-oh-no bogo --max-attempts 5000 3 2 1
```

## 🐱 Schrödinger Sort

*"You shouldn't have looked."*

### Inspiration

In 1935, Schrödinger came up with a thought experiment to show how weird quantum mechanics was. A cat is put in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, the cat dies. Quantum mechanics says the atom is in both states at once until observed — so the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Schrödinger's point was that this is ridiculous and something must be wrong with the theory. Physicists mostly just kept using the maths and agreed to argue about what it means later.

Schrödinger Sort puts a list in that box. It's sorted and unsorted at the same time — both states exist in superposition until the algorithm is asked for a result. At that point the wavefunction collapses into one outcome. The bias is built in: the worse outcome is always more likely, and the `--meanness` dial controls just how spiteful the universe feels today. If the list was already sorted going in, collapse to unsorted is guaranteed — the algorithm sees a sorted input, decides that's too convenient, and deliberately destroys it. There is no kindness here. The universe observed your smugly pre-sorted list and chose violence.

All numbers survive — none are dropped. They just end up in an order that was specifically chosen to annoy.

**How it works:**
1. Take the input list and produce two versions: sorted and shuffled. Both are shown — the list is simultaneously sorted and unsorted.
2. Observe it. The act of observation collapses it into one state.
3. It collapses into whichever state is least convenient, biased by `--meanness`.
4. If the input was already sorted, it always collapses to shuffled.

**Complexity:**
- Collapse: O(1)
- Computing sorted state: O(n log n)
- Regret: O(∞)

Optional parameter:
- `--meanness <0.0–1.0>` — how spiteful the universe feels today
  - `0.0`: kind universe — you're more likely to get sorted
  - `0.5`: roughly coin-flip behaviour
  - `1.0`: spiteful universe — you're more likely to get shuffled

```bash
# Sorted or shuffled — the universe decides
big-oh-no schrodinger 5 3 1 4

# Increase the meanness for worse odds
big-oh-no schrodinger --meanness 0.8 5 3 1 4

# Already sorted — collapse to unsorted is guaranteed
big-oh-no schrodinger 1 2 3
```

## 🚽 Urinal Sort

*"Personal space first. Correctness by accident."*

### Inspiration

Picture a men's bathroom with a row of urinals. A group of guys walks in one by one, each wearing a jersey with a number on it. They have one goal: pick the most comfortable stall. Not to sort themselves. Not to cooperate. Just to avoid standing near anyone else. The number on the jersey is irrelevant — nobody picks a stall based on what jersey they're wearing.

There are unwritten rules everyone follows without thinking: take the stall furthest from whoever's already there. Corners beat the middle when everything else is equal. Never stand next to someone if there's a gap.

If you watch the order people end up standing in and read their jersey numbers left to right, you get a new sequence. Send them out, queue them back up in that new order, and repeat. Sometimes, after enough rounds, the jerseys are in order. Not because anyone was trying to sort. Just because the etiquette happened to produce it.

That's Urinal Sort.

### Modelling the etiquette

Each person sizes up every empty stall and picks the best one — furthest from others, closest to a wall, least exposed. That intuition collapses into a single utility score:

$$U(s) = \underbrace{\frac{1}{s+1} + \frac{1}{n-s}}_{\text{wall attraction}} - \underbrace{\alpha \sum_{j \in J} \frac{1}{|s-j|}}_{\text{neighbour repulsion}}$$

**Wall attraction** — the left wall is one step beyond stall 0 (distance $s+1$); the right wall is one step beyond stall $n-1$ (distance $n-s$). Inverse distance: the nearer you are to a wall, the more it pulls. This is why the first person always heads for a corner — no neighbours yet, so wall pull is all that matters.

**Neighbour repulsion** — for every occupied stall `j`, we add $1/d$ where $d = |s-j|$. A neighbour at distance 1 contributes 1.0; at distance 2, just 0.5. Two neighbours at distance 1 give total pressure 2.0 — being flanked hurts twice as much as one neighbour at the same distance.

Walls and people use the same physics. Walls attract, people repel.

**`awkwardness`** $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ — how much discomfort a person feels around close neighbours. At `0.0`, they don't care how close others are. At `1.0`, they want to be as far from everyone as possible.

### How it works

1. Create `n` empty stalls. The numbers queue up in their current order.
2. Each person scores every empty stall by position alone — their value is just a label, it plays no part in stall selection — and takes the highest-scoring one.
3. Once everyone's seated, read the stalls left→right — that's the new order.
4. Repeat with the new order. Stop when sorted, or when the same arrangement comes back (cycle).

### Worked example: `[1, 3, 2]` — three stalls, `awkwardness = 0.5`

```
Stalls:  0    1    2
```

**Round 1**

`1` enters first — no neighbours. Both corner stalls score $1/1 + 1/3 \approx 1.33$, the middle scores $1/2 + 1/2 = 1.0$. Corners tie; stall 0 is chosen (lower index).

```
│ 1 │   │   │
```

`3` enters (occupied: {0}):

| Stall | Wall | Repulsion | U(s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1.00 | 1/1 = 1.00 | +0.50 |
| 2 | 1.33 | 1/2 = 0.50 | +1.08 |

Stall 2 is chosen.

```
│ 1 │   │ 3 │
```

`2` enters (occupied: {0, 2}) — only stall 1 is empty.

```
│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
```

Reading left→right: `[1, 2, 3]` ✓ sorted in one round.

### Counter-example: `[3, 2, 1]` — cycles immediately

`3` enters first every round — no neighbours. Both corners tie at 1.33; lower index wins. `3` takes stall 0 every round without exception.

With stall 0 taken, the second person always sees:

| Stall | Wall | Repulsion | U(s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1.00 | 1/1 = 1.00 | +0.50 |
| 2 | 1.33 | 1/2 = 0.50 | +1.08 |

Stall 2 wins. The third person is forced into stall 1.

Reading left→right gives `[3, ?, ?]` where the second and third seats swap every round:

```
Round 1:  [3, 2, 1]  →  3→stall 0,  2→stall 2,  1→stall 1  →  reading: [3, 1, 2]
Round 2:  [3, 1, 2]  →  3→stall 0,  1→stall 2,  2→stall 1  →  reading: [3, 2, 1]
💀 Cycle detected — same ordering last seen in round 1.
```

`3` is anchored to the left corner. `1` and `2` chase each other around it forever.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(rounds × n³)
- Space: O(n)
- Personal space violations: O(rounds × n)

**How does the number of urinals affect the chance of sorting?**

More urinals, worse odds. A lot worse. At 2 urinals it's a coin flip. At 5 the rate is down to 3%. At 8, across 200 random starting orderings, it never sorted once.

Each cell is the percentage of random starting orderings that produced a sorted result, tested at different `--max-rounds` limits:

| Urinals | max=1 | max=2 | max=3 | max=5 | max=10 | max=50 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 2 | 50% | 50% | 50% | 50% | 50% | 50% |
| 3 | 34% | 34% | 34% | 34% | 34% | 34% |
| 4 | 9% | 13.5% | 13.5% | 13.5% | 13.5% | 13.5% |
| 5 | 2% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% |
| 6 | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% |
| 8+ | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

Giving it more rounds doesn't help. At 4 urinals there's a small jump from round 1 to round 2, then nothing — by round 3 everything that was going to sort already has. The reason is cycle detection: once people fall into a repeated pattern, no further rounds will break it. Either they sort early or they loop forever.

`--awkwardness` doesn't move the needle either. It was tested across every combination and the sort rates didn't budge.

Options:
- `--awkwardness <0.0–1.0>` — neighbour discomfort (0 = indifferent, 1 = maximise distance from everyone; default `0.5`)
- `--max-rounds <n>` — give up after this many rounds (default `200`; cycle detection usually fires first)

```bash
# Sorts in one round
big-oh-no urinal 1 3 2

# Cycles forever (detected immediately)
big-oh-no urinal 3 2 1

# Larger input — may sort, may cycle
big-oh-no urinal 8 3 6 1 9 2

# α=0: neighbour repulsion disabled, stall choice by wall proximity only
big-oh-no urinal --awkwardness 0.0 8 3 6 1 9 2

# α=1: neighbour repulsion at full weight
big-oh-no urinal --awkwardness 1.0 8 3 6 1 9 2
```

## 🗂️ Digit Sort

*"I don't rank people. I file them."*

### Inspiration

Before computers could sort data, Herman Hollerith's 1887 tabulating machines processed US census punch cards by sorting them into physical bins — one column at a time. No card was ever compared to another. Each card was simply read at the relevant column and dropped into the corresponding bin. When all bins were collected in order, the data was sorted. It was mechanical, methodical, and deeply bureaucratic.

Digit Sort is that same idea wearing a suit. Every number gets examined one digit at a time, routed to its designated bucket, and collected with all the others when the pass is complete. Nobody asks whether 802 is bigger than 45. That's not how filing works. The routing code is all that matters.

### The persona

The Bucket Bureaucrat runs the Department of Numerical Classification. Their desk is immaculate. Their procedures are documented on Form 7G. They process each number in the order received, examine the relevant digit column, and deposit the number into the appropriate bucket — no more, no less. Comparisons are not within their remit. Comparisons, in fact, are strictly prohibited under Section 4(b).

They will sort your list. They will produce the correct result. They will never once look at two numbers and decide which is bigger. And frankly, they find the idea offensive.

### How it works

1. Find the maximum number in the batch — determine how many digit columns need processing
2. Starting from the **ones digit**, route each number into bucket 0–9 based solely on that digit
3. Collect buckets 0 through 9 in order, preserving arrival order within each bucket
4. Repeat for the **tens**, **hundreds**, **thousands**, … digit columns
5. After all columns are processed, the list is sorted

**No number is ever compared to any other number.**

### Worked example

```
Input: [170, 45, 75, 90, 2, 802, 66]

Pass 1 — ones digit:
  Bucket 0: [170, 90]    (ones digit is 0)
  Bucket 2: [2, 802]     (ones digit is 2)
  Bucket 5: [45, 75]     (ones digit is 5)
  Bucket 6: [66]         (ones digit is 6)
  → [170, 90, 2, 802, 45, 75, 66]

Pass 2 — tens digit:
  Bucket 0: [2, 802]     (tens digit is 0)
  Bucket 4: [45]         (tens digit is 4)
  Bucket 6: [66]         (tens digit is 6)
  Bucket 7: [170, 75]    (tens digit is 7)
  Bucket 9: [90]         (tens digit is 9)
  → [2, 802, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]

Pass 3 — hundreds digit:
  Bucket 0: [2, 45, 66, 75, 90]   (hundreds digit is 0)
  Bucket 1: [170]                  (hundreds digit is 1)
  Bucket 8: [802]                  (hundreds digit is 8)
  → [2, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]  ✓ Sorted
```

At no point was "is 170 greater than 45?" ever asked. Each pass just reads a digit and files the number.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(d × n) where d = number of digits in the largest value, n = count of elements
- Space: O(n + 10) — the 10 buckets never grow beyond the input size combined
- Comparisons: **0**

```bash
# Sort [170, 45, 75, 90, 2, 802, 66] in 3 passes
big-oh-no digit 170 45 75 90 2 802 66

# Works with duplicates too
big-oh-no digit 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6
```
